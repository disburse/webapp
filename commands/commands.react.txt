1. To save a node module as a dependency in the package json files:
    npm install web3 --save

2. To install UI components and CSS style sheets:
    npm install semantic-ui-react --save
    npm install semantic-ui-css --save

This command will save the web3 package as a dependency of the webapp project.

To start react app with command: npm start

3. For navigation install: 
    npm install --save react-router-dom

FIX: When using react-router-dom and on localhost links worked fine, until I pushed my repo to github 
and deployed it to netlify the links didn't work.  To correct this I adding a _redirect file inside public/ 
folder and put /* /index.html 200 inside of that file.  Link navigation now works.

An example of how navigation works can be found here:

4. Wallet connections:
